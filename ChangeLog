    * src/utils.c, src/utils.h (new): Utility functions moved here.
    * src/brogw_config.c, src/brogw_config.h (new): Configuration loading.
    * src/matcher.c, src/matcher.h (new): Pattern matching with regex.
    * src/executor.c, src/executor.h (new): Command execution.
    * src/main.c: Removed inline code for config loading, URL matching,
      and command execution. Now delegates to the above modules.

    Reorganize code into separate modules for better maintainability
    and clarity.
