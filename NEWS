* Release 1.1, 2024-12-XX

** Improved build portability.
The program now supports compilation on Windows, extending
cross-platform compatibility.

** Simplified the 'configure.ac' script.
Removing unnecessary complexity and options. This should make the
configuration process more transparent and maintainable.

** Introduced continuous integration on GitHub.
Introduced minimal CI workflows for GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows
builds.  Each commit or pull request is now automatically built and
tested across these platforms.

** Added automatic generation of 'src/config.h'.
This is intended for future flexibility in feature toggles and
platform-specific conditions.

** Routing to any input.
Brogw now supports routing of any non-empty input, including local
file paths (e.g., '~/file.html') and custom schemes (e.g., `file://`,
`ftp://`).  Removed the restrictive check requiring input to start
with 'http://' or 'https://'.

** Improved error handling.
Added validation to reject empty string inputs, e.g., 'brogw ""'.

** Code cleanup.
Cleaned up runtime output by removing unnecessary debug logs.

** Improved integration with desktop environments.
Updated the '.desktop' file to conform with the Freedesktop Desktop
Entry specification.  Added 'Version', 'GenericName', 'Terminal' and
'StartupNofify' fields to ensure proper behavior in graphical
environments.
