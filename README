This directory tree holds version 1.1 of Brogw, a lightweight
utility to route links to appropriate web browsers and profiles based
on user-defined rules.  This tool is particularly useful for users
managing multiple browsers or profiles for work and personal tasks.

The file INSTALL in this directory contains instructions for building
and installing Brogw on various systems, once you have unpacked or
checked out the entire Brogw file tree.  Please read it carefully
before proceeding.

See the file etc/NEWS for information on new features and other
user-visible changes in recent versions of Brogw.

The file CONTRIBUTE contains information on contributing to Brogw as a
developer.

You may encounter bugs in this release.  If you do, please report
them; your bug reports are valuable contributions to project
maintainers, since they allow us to notice and fix problems on
machines we don't have, or in code I don't use often.  Please send bug
reports to the mailing list gnu@serghei.pl.  If possible, use GitHub
issue tracker at <https://github.com/sergeyklay/brogw/issues>.

The 'etc' subdirectory contains several other files, named in capital
letters, which you might consider looking at when installing Brogw.

The file 'configure' is a shell script to acclimate Brogw to the
oddities of your processor and operating system.  It creates the file
'Makefile' (a script for the 'make' program), which automates the
process of building and installing Brogw.  See INSTALL for more
detailed information.

The file 'configure.ac' is the input used by the autoconf program to
construct the 'configure' script.

The shell script 'autogen.sh' generates 'configure' and other files by
running Autoconf (which in turn uses GNU m4), and configures files in
the '.git' subdirectory if you are using Git.  If you want to use it,
you will need to install recent versions of these build tools.  This
should be needed only if you edit files like 'configure.ac' that
specify Brogw's autobuild procedure.

The 'Makefile.am' files contain high-level instructions for Automake.
They describe the project's structure, including the Brogw program and
its dependencies.  Automake uses 'Makefile.am' to generate
'Makefile.in' files, which serve as templates with detailed build
instructions.  During the configuration process, the 'configure'
script processes these 'Makefile.in' files to create the final
'Makefile', tailored to the user's specific system environment.

The file 'make-dist' is a shell script to build a distribution tar
file from the current Brogw tree, containing only those files
appropriate for distribution.  If you make extensive changes to Brogw,
this script will help you distribute your version to others.

There are several subdirectories:

'src'       holds the C source code for the Brogw application.
'etc'       holds miscellaneous architecture-independent data files Brogw
            uses, like example of the configuration file, desktop entry
            files for integrating Brogw with desktop environments.
            The contents of the 'info', and 'doc' subdirectories are
            architecture-independent too.
'info'      holds the Info documentation tree for Brogw.
'doc/brogw' holds the source code for the Brogw Manual.  If you modify the
            manual sources, you will need the 'makeinfo' program to produce
            an updated manual.  'makeinfo' is part of the GNU Texinfo
            package; you need a suitably recent version of Texinfo.
'build-aux' holds auxiliary files used during the build.
'm4'        holds Autoconf macros used for generating the configure script.

Note: If you modify files like 'configure.ac' or 'Makefile.am', you
may need to regenerate the 'configure' script and 'Makefile' using
'autogen.sh' or 'autoreconf'.
