* How developers contribute to Brogw

Here is how software developers can contribute to Brogw.

** The Emacs repository

Brogw development uses Git on GitHub for its main repository.
To configure Git for Brogw development, you can run the following:

	git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
	git config --global user.email 'your.name@example.com'

The following shell commands then build and run Brogw from scratch:

	git clone git://github.com/sergeyklay/brogw.git
	cd brogw
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	src/brogw
