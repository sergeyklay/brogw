This file contains general information on building and installing
Brogw.

BASIC INSTALLATION

To build and install Brogw on most Unix systems, follow these
steps:

  1.  Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

      - C99 compatible compiler
      - GNU make
      - Autoconf
      - Automake

  2.  Generate the configure script by running:

          autoreconf --install

  3.  Run the configure script to adapt the build process to your
      system:

          ./configure

      You may pass additional options to customize the
      installation. For example, to install in a user-specific
      directory:

          ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local

      Refer to the "CONFIGURE OPTIONS" section below for more details.

  4.  Build the program by running:

          make

  5.  Install the program (requires root privileges unless you
      specified a user-specific prefix):

          make install

      By default, the program is installed in /usr/local/bin. The
      configuration file example is placed in
      /etc/brogw/config.conf.example.

  6.  Create your configuration file based on the example provided:

          cp /etc/brogw/config.conf.example ~/.config/brogw/config.conf

      Edit this file to define your routing rules.

  7.  Integrate Brogw with your desktop environment:

          xdg-settings set default-web-browser brogw.desktop

      This ensures that all HTTP and HTTPS links are routed through
      Brogw.

  8.  Test the installation by running:

          brogw https://example.com

      This should open the URL using the appropriate browser as per
      your configuration.

CONFIGURE OPTIONS

You can pass various options to the ./configure script to customize
the build process. Common options include:

  --prefix=PREFIX   Specify the installation prefix. Default is
                    /usr/local.
  --sysconfdir=DIR  Specify the directory for system-wide configuration
                    files. Default is PREFIX/etc.
  --bindir=DIR      Specify the directory for executable programs.
                    Default is PREFIX/bin.

For detailed help use ./configure --help command.

CLEANING UP

After installation, you can remove the build artifacts to save space:

    make clean

If you need to reconfigure the build process or start fresh, run:

    make distclean
